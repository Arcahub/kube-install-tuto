# Introduction

Welcome to this tutorial about Kubernetes. This tutorial is intended for people who want to learn how to install and configure a Kubernetes cluster. It is also intended for people who want to understand how Kubernetes works.

This tutorial is based on the [official documentation of Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs). The documentation is very good, so I recommend you to read it if you want to learn more about Kubernetes or if you need help with a specific topic.

This course is divided into the following sections:

- [Introduction](introduction.md): This page
- [Kubernetes Components](k8s-components.md): Kubernetes components
- [Infrastructure Provisioning](infrastructure.md): How to provision infrastructure for Kubernetes
- [Installation](installation.md): How to install Kubernetes
- [Understanding what we have done](understanding.md): Understanding what we have done
- [Upgrading cluster version](version-upgrade.md): How to upgrade Kubernetes cluster version
- [Create a user for a developer](create-user.md): How to create a user for a developer
- [External access && Ingress](external-access.md): How to access Kubernetes cluster from outside
- [Bonus](bonus.md): Bonus

## Prerequisites

This course is written to be given in a school so it will be using Scaleway as a cloud provider. However, you can follow this tutorial without using Scaleway. You will just need to provision your own infrastructure.
