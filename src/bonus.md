# Bonus

Well, this is the end of this tutorial. I hope you enjoyed it and learned something. If you want to learn more about Kubernetes, I recommend you to read the official documentation. It is very good and you will find everything you need to know about Kubernetes.

For people who want to go further, I have a few suggestions:

- [Kubernetes the hard way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way)
- Use [kubespray](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray) to install Kubernetes
- Test to setup a LoadBalancer with another cloud provider than Scaleway
- Deploy a cluster with 5 nodes instead of 3 (2 control plane and 3 workers)
